#  On your webserver you need a file which is defined by 
#  $request and as an example is made a little obscure
#  it is called _._lb_maintance on your webserver
#  on the $url you need to define if it is http:// or https://

#  
#  The syntax of the file is state keywords "online" "halt" "drain" "showtime"
#  "showtime" is here to ensure lbcli does nothing and is needed for the 
#  healthcheck to work when the server is online and no change is needed
#  this is a Layer4 healthcheck and is not designed for Layer7 HAProxy.
